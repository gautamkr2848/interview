Design a calendar Application (similar on lines with Google's Calendar)

It should support the following functionalities : Ability to create, update, delete an Event

    a. An event would typically consist of {start, end, location, Owner, user-list, title}.
    b. Events can either be like meetings(with a dedicated location and appropriate guest-list)
        or as well be like reminders etc.
    c. An event once created, can be either accepted or rejected by the constituent users
    d. CMS for user calender details
    e. Get specific Event details.

Event Type : TYPE1, TYPE2

User table
    Id, name, mobile, email, created_at, updated_at

Event Table
    Id, title, owner, start_time, end_time, location, event_type, created_at, updated_at

User - Event Mapping
    Id, event_id, user_id, is_accepted


Estimations
    Capacity planning
        Assume that this system is designed for users: 100M
        Daily Active Users for creating meetings → 20M daily active.
        On an avg. an active user will schedule 2 meetings in a day. → 20M
        On an avg. a user will receive 4 meetings invites.  → 40M

        Total = 100 M * 1 KB =  100GB
        Calendar Invites
                Invites = 2 * 20M * 365
        Total = 40M * 400 * 200 Bytes = 32 * 10 ^11 = 3200 GB
        Total Space = 3200GB + 200 GB = 3.4 TB  = ~4 TB

    Query per second

    Read QPS
        Check calendar, check availability

        40M * 2 (times in a day) +  40M (Events created in a day) * 3 (Check availability of 3 users)  = 200M
        QPS = 2000

        Write QPS
            Create, Cancel & modify
            Create → 40M + 4M + 4M = ~50M
            QPS = 50M / 86400 = 50 * 10^6/ 10^5 = 500
