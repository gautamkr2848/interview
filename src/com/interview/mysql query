1. Employees earning more than their manager

    SELECT a.Name FROM Employee AS a, Employee AS b WHERE a.ManagerId = b.Id AND a.Salary > b.Salary;

2. How to find duplicates in a table

SELECT order_id, count(order_id) from order group_by order_id having count(order_id) > 1;

3.  How to delete duplicates from a table

DELETE t1 FROM contacts t1  INNER JOIN contacts t2 WHERE t1.id < t2.id AND t1.email = t2.email;

WITH CTE as (Select *, row_number() over (partition by emp_id order by emp_id) as rn from emp)
DELETE from CTE where rn > 1;

4.  Difference between union and union all

UNION returns distinct records from both the table, while UNION ALL returns all the records from both the tables

Select emp_id from emp1 UNION Select emp_id from emp1;
Select emp_id from emp1 UNION ALL Select emp_id from emp1;

5. Employees who are not present in department table

SELECT * from emp where dept_id not in (select id from department);

SELECT * from emp LEFT JOIN dept on emp.dept_id = dept.id where dept.id is null;

📌 Leetcode 183 - Customers Who Never Order

SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id=o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;


📌 LeetCode 184 - Department Highest Salary

first identify highest salary by
SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY departmentId

Then JOIN both table by
SELECT d.name AS Department , e.name AS Employee, e.salary FROM Department d JOIN Employee e ON e.departmentId=d.id

Then put Condition by
WHERE(departmentId, salary) IN (SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY departmentId) ;

Code

SELECT d.name AS Department , e.name AS Employee, e.salary
FROM Department d JOIN Employee e ON e.departmentId = d.id
WHERE(departmentId, salary) IN (SELECT departmentId,MAX(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY departmentId)

5. DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE

       DELETE
           DML command
           Used to delete one or more records of a table
           Slower than the TRUNCATE command
           We can use the “ROLLBACK” command to restore

       DROP
           DDL command
           Used to drop the whole table
           We can’t restore the table by using the “ROLLBACK” command because it auto commits.

       TRUNCATE
           DDL command
           Used to delete all the rows of a table in one go
           With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used
           Faster than the delete command
           We can’t restore the tuples of the table by using the “ROLLBACK” command.

6. Find second highest salary

    SELECT salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary desc limit n-1,1

7. Find second highest salary employees in each department

    SELECT t.deptno, max(t.salary) as 2nd_max_salary FROM emp t WHERE
    t.salary < (SELECT max(salary) FROM emp t2 WHERE t2.deptno = t.deptno) GROUP BY t.deptno;

    SELECT * FROM (SELECT emp.*, dense_rank() over (partition by dept_id order by salary desc) as rn from emp) a where rn = 2;

9. Explain order of execution of SQL.

    a. FROM and JOINs - The FROM clause, and subsequent JOINs are first executed to determine the total working set of
    data that is being queried. This includes subqueries in this clause, and can cause temporary tables to be created
    under the hood containing all the columns and rows of the tables being joined.

    b. WHERE - Once we have the total working set of data, the first-pass WHERE constraints are applied to the individual
    rows, and rows that do not satisfy the constraint are discarded. Each of the constraints can only access columns
    directly from the tables requested in the FROM clause. Aliases in the SELECT part of the query are not accessible
    in most databases since they may include expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed.

    c. GROUP BY - The remaining rows after the WHERE constraints are applied are then grouped based on common values in
    the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. As a result of the grouping, there will only be as many rows as there
    are unique values in that column. Implicitly, this means that you should only need to use this when you have aggregate
    functions in your query.

    d. HAVING - If the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the constraints in the HAVING clause are then applied to the
    grouped rows, discard the grouped rows that don't satisfy the constraint. Like the WHERE clause, aliases are also
    not accessible from this step in most databases.

    e. SELECT - Any expressions in the SELECT part of the query are finally computed.

    f. DISTINCT - Of the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as DISTINCT will be discarded.

    g. ORDER BY - If an order is specified by the ORDER BY clause, the rows are then sorted by the specified data in
    either ascending or descending order. Since all the expressions in the SELECT part of the query have been computed,
    you can reference aliases in this clause.

    h. LIMIT / OFFSET - Finally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by the LIMIT and OFFSET are discarded,
    leaving the final set of rows to be returned from the query.

10. What is difference between where and having?

WHERE clause filters individual rows, whereas the HAVING clause filters groups instead of one row at a time. We cannot
use the WHERE clause with aggregate functions because it works for filtering individual rows. In contrast, HAVING can
works with aggregate functions because it is used to filter groups.

SELECT dept_id, avg(salary) from emp where salary > 10000 group by dept_id having avg(salary) > 12000;

11. Convert rows data to column

SELECT emp_id,
sum(case when salary_component_type = 'salary' then val end) as salary,
sum(case when salary_component_type = 'bonus' then val end) as bonus,
sum(case when salary_component_type = 'hike_percentage' then val end) as hike_percentage
into emp_compensation_pivot from emp_compensation group by emp_id;

SELECT * from
(SELECT emp_id, 'salary' as salary_component_type, salary as val from emp_compensation_pivot UNION ALL
SELECT emp_id, 'bonus' as salary_component_type, bonus as val from emp_compensation_pivot UNION ALL
SELECT emp_id, 'hike_percentage' as salary_component_type, hike_percentage as val from emp_compensation_pivot) a
order by emp_id;

12. Explain all types of joins in SQL?

13. What are triggers in SQL?

An SQL trigger is a database object that is associated with a table and automatically executes a set of SQL statements
when a specific event occurs on that table. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and
automate certain actions within a database.

14. What is stored procedure in SQL

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again. So if you
have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

15. Explain all types of window functions? (Mainly rank, row_num, dense_rank, lead & lag)

16. What are Views?

Views are some kind of virtual tables created by original tables from the database. Views actually do not hold the
actual data and just have the definition of the original data.

15. What is difference between varchar and nvarchar?

varchar stores - 1 byte & nvarchar stores - 2 byte data

18. Difference between Function and Store procedure ?

The function must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional. Even a procedure can return zero or n values.
Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas Procedures can have input or output parameters. Functions can
be called from Procedure whereas Procedures cannot be called from a Function.

19. Do we use variable in views? - no

20.People working for walmart , flipkar and microsoft we want to say product based else sevrice based

select student_id,student_name, student_company,
CASE WHEN student_company in ('flipkart','walmart','microsoft')
         THEN 'product based' ELSE 'service based'
END as company_type from students;

21. If course more than 4 months we categorize as Master's program else diploma program

select course_id,course_name,course_fee,
    CASE WHEN course_duration_in_months > 4
THEN 'masters' ELSE 'diploma'
     END as course_type from courses;

23. Create a table only structure

CREATE TABLE NewTable AS SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo;
SELECT * INTO NewTable FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE 1 = 0;

24. Write a query to add email validation

SELECT Email FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Email, ‘[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}’, ‘i’);

25. WHERE vs HAVING vs GROUP BY

-- Find the source_of_joining through which more than 1 student has enrolled

SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total from students GROUP BY source_of_joining WHERE total > 1;

Error: ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE total > 1' at
line 1

** WHERE clause is used to filter the individual records before GROUP BY or aggregation.

SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total from students GROUP BY source_of_joining HAVING total > 1;

** HAVING clause is used to filter the records after GROUP BY or aggregation.

--  Find the total number of students who have enrolled through linkedin as source_of_joining

-- OPTIMISED QUERY (Filtering is happening before aggregation)
SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total FROM students WHERE source_of_joining = 'linkedin' GROUP BY source_of_joining;

or

-- NON-OPTIMISEZ QUERY (Filtering is happening after aggregation)
SELECT source_of_joining, COUNT(*) AS total FROM students GROUP BY source_of_joining HAVING source_of_joining = 'linkedin';

------------------------------------------------------
Can we use WHERE and HAVING clause in the same query ?
------------------------------------------------------

-- Find the locations from which more than 1 student has joined & the students years_of_exp is more than 5 years

SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS total from students WHERE years_of_exp > 5 GROUP BY location HAVING total > 1;
