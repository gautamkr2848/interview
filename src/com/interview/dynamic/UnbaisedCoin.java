Find the probability of getting heads more number of times than tails.

Input: p[] = {0.3, 0.4, 0.7}
Output: 0.442

Probability for a tail = (1 – Probability for a head)

For heads greater than tails, there are 4 possibilities:
P({head, head, tail}) = 0.3 x 0.4 x (1 – 0.7) = 0.036
P({tail, head, head}) = (1 – 0.3) x 0.4 x 0.7 = 0.196
P({head, tail, head}) = 0.3 x (1 – 0.4) x 0.7= 0.126
P({head, head, head}) = 0.3 x 0.4 x 0.7 = 0.084

Adding the above probabilities
0.036 + 0.196 + 0.126 + 0.084 = 0.442

The idea is to use dynamic programming. Let’s assume dp[i][j] to be the probability of
getting j heads with first i coins. To get j heads at the ith position, there are two possibilities:

    1. If number of heads till (i – 1) coins is equal to j then a tail comes at ith.
    2. If number of heads till (i – 1) coins is equal to (j – 1) then a head comes at ith position

Hence, it can be broken into its subproblems as follows:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i – 1][j] * (1 – p[i]) + dp[i – 1][j – 1] * p[i]
