Design a calendar Application (similar on lines with Google's Calendar)

It should support the following functionalities : Ability to create, update, delete an Event

    a. An event would typically consist of {start, end, location, Owner, user-list, title}.
    b. Events can either be like meetings(with a dedicated location and appropriate guest-list)
        or as well be like reminders etc.
    c. An event once created, can be either accepted or rejected by the constituent users
    d. Get Calendar for a user Ui
    e. Get Event details.

Event Type : TYPE1, TYPE2

User table
    Id, name, mobile, email, created_at, updated_at

Event Table
    Id, title, owner, start_time, end_time, location, event_type, created_at, updated_at

User - Event Mapping
    Id, event_id, user_id, is_accepted


Estimations
    Capacity planning
        Assume that this system is designed for users: 100M
        Daily Active Users for creating meetings → 20M daily active.
        On an avg. an active user will schedule 2 meetings in a day. → 20M
        On an avg. a user will receive 4 meetings invites.  → 40M

        Total = 100M * 1000 B = 100 * 10 ^ 9 = 100GB
        Calendar Invites
                Invites = 2 * 20M * 365
        Total = 40M * 400 * 200 Bytes = 32 * 10 ^11 = 3200 GB
        Total Space = 3200GB + 200 GB = 3.4 TB  = ~4 TB

    Query per second

    Read QPS
        Check calendar, check availability

        40M * 2 (times in a day) +  40M (Events created in a day) * 3 (Check availability of 3 users)  = 200M
        QPS = 2000

        Write QPS
            Create, Cancel & modify
            Create → 40M + 4M + 4M = ~50M
            QPS = 50M / 86400 = 50 * 10^6/ 10^5 = 500
