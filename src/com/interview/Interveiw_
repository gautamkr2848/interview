1. Tree Reverse Order Traversal
2. Mutex vs Semaphore

    A mutex is a binary semaphore. But it's not! The purpose of mutex and semaphore are different. Maybe, due to similarity
    in their implementation a mutex would be referred to as a binary semaphore.

    Strictly speaking, a mutex is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task can acquire
    the mutex. It means there is ownership associated with a mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex).

    Semaphore is signaling mechanism (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal).

    A programmer should prefer mutex rather than creating a semaphore with count 1.

5. ServiceDiscovery - Eureka

    A microservices-based application typically runs in virtualized or containerized environments. The number of instances
    of a service and its locations changes dynamically. We need to know where these instances are and their names to allow
    requests to arrive at the target microservice. This is where tactics such as Service Discovery come into play.

    The Service Discovery mechanism helps us know where each instance is located. In this way, a Service Discovery
    component acts as a registry in which the addresses of all instances are tracked.

6. @ControllerAdvice - It's a specialization of the @Component annotation which allows to handle exceptions across the
    whole application in one global handling component.

7. Functional Interface and Lambda Expression
9. Mysql vs Nosql

    MySQL is most suitable for use cases that require high availability and data consistency, such as e-commerce applications.
    Cassandra is most suitable for use cases that require high scalability and performance, such as social media applications.

10. OOPS
11. Overloading vs overriding vs methodhiding
12. Monolith vs microservices
13. Singleton vs static method

    Use a Singleton when you want to control access to a single instance and provide a global point of access to that instance.
    Use static methods when you have utility functions that do not depend on the state of an instance.

14. Custom Exception Handling
15. Spring vs Springboot

    In the Spring framework, you have to build configurations manually. In Spring Boot there are default configurations
    that allow faster bootstrapping.

        c. Avoid Getting the Size of the Collection in the Loop
        e. Use Primitive Types Wherever Possible
        f. Avoid Using BigDecimal Class
        g. Avoid Creating Big Objects Often
        h. Use Stored Procedures Instead of Queries

19. String immutability

        a. Security: parameters are typically represented as String in network connections, database connection urls,
           usernames/passwords etc. If it were mutable, these parameters could be easily changed.
        b. Synchronization and concurrency: making String immutable automatically makes them thread safe thereby solving the
           synchronization issues.
        c. Performance: We used to store string in a String pool. String pool improves efficiency by reducing heap memory.
            The JVM verifies if the value already exists inside the String pool when we want to declare a new String object.
            If it already exists, the new object is given the same value. If two objects have same value (a="test", and
            b="test") and thus you need only one string object (for both a and b, these two will point to the same object).
        d. Immutability gives the security of loading the correct class by Classloader.

2. Builder Pattern

    Builder is a design pattern that allows you to avoid having constructors with a long list of parameters, not all of
    which are required. It allows you to build instances of a certain object in a more flexible way, since it lets you
    configure only those attributes that are strictly necessary.
